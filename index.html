<p>Wave-particle duality quantified for the first time BY SHASHANK
 One of the most counterintuitive concepts in physics – the idea that
 quantum objects are complementary, behaving like waves in some situations
 and like particles in others – just got a new and more quantitative foundation. 
In a twist on the classic double-slit experiment, scientists at Korea’s Institute for
 Basic Sciences (IBS) used precisely controlled photon sources to measure a photon’s
 degree of wave-ness and particle-ness. Their results, published in Science Advances, show 
that the properties of the photon’s source influence its wave and particle character – a discovery 
that complicates and challenges the common understanding of complementarity.
The double-slit experiment is the archetypal example of complementarity at work.
 When a single photon encounters a barrier with two thin openings, it produces an 
interference pattern on a screen placed behind the openings – but only if the photon’s 
path is not observed. This interference pattern identifies the photon as a wave since a particle
 would create only one point of light on the screen. However, if detectors are placed at the openings
 to determine which slit the photon went through, the interference pattern disappears, and the photon 
behaves like a particle. The principle of complementarity states that both experimental outcomes are needed 
to fully understand the photon’s quantum nature.
Signal and idler
The new study adds to this principle by showing that the properties of the slits also matter. In their experiment, 
the IBS researchers shone so-called “seed beams” of laser light onto two crystals of lithium niobate. Each crystal 
produces two photons when illuminated: a “signal” photon and an “idler” photon. The researchers sent the signal photon
 into an interferometer to create interference patterns and quantify the photon’s wave nature, while observing the path
 of the idler photon to pinpoint its particle character. Because the signal and idler photons are produced together, they
 form a single quantum state described by both the wave and the particle property measurements.
